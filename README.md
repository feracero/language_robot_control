# language_robot_control
Using language for robot control.

To get started, create a file "openai_api_key.txt" and paste your key. Make sure this file is saved as per the file name included in .gitigore , as you would *never* want to push your API key to a public repository!

You can then run example.py to test the language controller on a dummy 2D grid environment.
