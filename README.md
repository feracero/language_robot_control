# language_robot_control
Using language for robot control.

To get started, create a file `openai_api_key.txt` and paste your key. Make sure this file is saved as per this exact file name (as this is what is included in `.gitigore`), as you would **never** want to push your API key to a public repository! You can also save this somewhere else (e.g. your Desktop) and modify the script accordingly. 

Once you have an API key set up, you can then run example.py to test the language controller on a dummy 2D grid environment.
